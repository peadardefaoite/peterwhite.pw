      <description>Update (02-07-2018): So it seems like the docs have been updated and a new way of publishing GitHub Pages through a /docs/ folder is available. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone with this approach instead, which puts the Hugo config and published content in the same repo, which may not be ideal, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s better than what I had before. New site, new technology to generate it, what could go wrong?! As it turns out, quite a bit.</description>

      <description>So a new personal website has found its way onto the internet. This will probably be forgotten about in short order, but who knows, I might surprise myself and actually maintain this. At least I&amp;rsquo;m hosting it on GitHub Pages so my wallet won&amp;rsquo;t be decimated.&#xA;For those who may be interested, this site was built using Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages, a nice and free way to host your own site.</description>
