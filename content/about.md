You've found this site somewhere and now get to read all about me. Congratulations!

I'm an applied mathematician turned software engineer. 
You can read all my career history on LinkedIn on the sidebar as well 
as a [public version of my CV here](/public_cv.pdf). 
I used to live in Galway, Ireland but have since moved to ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
