Oops, guess it's been a while since I was supposed to do Australia Part 3. In my defence, I was having fun travelling and didn't think to blog. I'll get around to the rest of my posts about my trip soon, especially now that I've returned back to Ireland.

After leaving Sydney, I flew southward to Melbourne, the food capital of Australia with an extraordinary amount of coffee shops. Sadly that was lost on me, being only a tea drinker.


Melbourne as a city has got a really great vibe and is definitely a place I could see myself living in. However, as a backpacking tourist, I found it hard to find cheap places to eat out, and for the budget traveller, there wasn't too much else to do in the city itself. Having been to much cheaper places after Australia, I would recommend only going here if you have money to burn.


Melbourne is renowned for its street art, and it's easy to see why. It's quite impressive to wander the city and see the most random pieces like an Irish flag or a Transformer! It adds to the chilled out vibe that would make me want to live here.


After Melbourne came Ta-ta-tasmania, which I only spent a week at. Unfortunately I got a cold at the start, which ate into my quality time there. A wander through the botanic gardens that are a staple of each Australian city helped ease it a wee bit.


Tasmania is about the size of Ireland which puts into perspective just how big Australia is for someone on the other side of the world. I absolutely loved Tasmania and there's so much nature to visit and go on hikes to. I wish I had more time there but I imagine I'll come back for another visit. I realise how fortunate I am that I got to see the native wildlife here that is so different to anything else I've experienced.

I'll finish with a video of those Tasmanian devils (nothing like the cartoon though), the cutest creatures that can probably devour every bit of me.
