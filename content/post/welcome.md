So a new personal website has found its way onto the internet. This will 
probably be forgotten about in short order, but who knows, I might surprise 
myself and actually maintain this. At least I'm hosting it on GitHub Pages so 
my wallet won't be decimated.

For those who may be interested, this site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted 
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), a nice and free way to host your own site.
