Oops, must have forgotten about this blog. Well, fear not, here's a fresh update.

I've just gone through the procedure of registering a domain with [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), which was surprisingly easy. Next stage was to integrate this with my existing GitHub Pages setup, which I'm sure would throw a few wobblies, but nope, that was also easy enough.

I basically followed these docs on [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages) and [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) and voila, I had everything setup. The longest portion of the process was waiting for DNS records to propagate, which took about 20 minutes, though that could can take up to a day or so.

So yeah, new domain, I'm slowly turning this into a working site.
