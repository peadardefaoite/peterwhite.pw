Quite a bit of time since the last update. I wish I could say I was backpacking with
no internet, but unfortunately, after a bad experience in India, I decided to pause
my travels for a while, mainly sticking to Europe for a few months. After a bit of 
soul-searching, I kicked off my travels again with Australia in January, deciding to
leave Asia for the future. I'm already finished with Australia, so this series of posts 
will just go over my experience there.

First place to visit in Oz was Brisbane and Gold Coast. The change in temperature coming
from winter in Ireland to Australia was ... intense to say the least! Being in 30 degree
weather with high humidity was a lot to take. Thankfully air-conditioning exists.

First proper experience was getting to see Florence + The Machine live in Riverstage in 
Brisbane, which I had booked around the time my trip started back in August. Glad to see 
them again after so many years since their last concert.

Next on the list was going to the famous Byron Bay, the most easterly point of Australia. 
It was just a day trip, but absolutely gorgeous views from the lighthouse against the backdrop 
of the Pacific Ocean.

Along with visiting Surfers Paradise in Gold Coast, which was a little bit crowded with the 
end of summer holidays, there's also quite a few theme parks nearby. It had been a while since 
my last roller coaster, but the sensation came flooding back to me as I screamed my head off.

A bit south of Gold Coast is the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, where I got to actually pet a 
kangaroo! When you live on the other side of the world, getting to touch such an exotic animal 
was a joy, and it was not a disappointment, especially when their fur is so soft.

Next post: Sydney and Wollongong.
